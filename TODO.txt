TODO
- WP menus (bookmarked youtube tutorial)
- WP menu search

FUTURE TODO
- Styling for page and post (top heading top margin)
- archive.php + styling
- search.php (not official name) + styling
- recommendations.php (probably just search.php for recommendations tags without the search bar) + styling
- Post tags

DONE
- learn about coffee culture

PAST
- latest posts doesn't list most recent post (which is already featured at the top)
- limit excerpt length

- post headline image (styling)
- featured post
- limit home page posts to 6
- latest articles on front-page.php. it displays "Home" because it uses a WP Page (the page has the instagram feed)--the current WP Query is for the page "Home" and not the site in general. Potential fix is to change the query and use something other than have_posts()
- embed instagram posts
- fixed scrolling bug
- restyle bottom logos (Follow Us)
- removed commented css and js

- remove scrolling when mobile menu is open
- move mobile menu with scroll y position
- move open mobile menu with user presses tab
- click outside mobile menu to close it
