DONE

PAST

- search recommendations by tag
- BUG: Hamburger menu disappears on 320 width

- archive.php + styling
- pagination on archive.php
- Deleted searchpage.php
- BUG: search doesn't work on pages other than home and search

- style search.php for everything larger than mobile
- searchform.php styling
- replace non-functional search forms

- search.php + mobile styling

- tag styling
- Post tags
- Add Related Posts
- added do_shortcode('[instagram-feed]') to front-page

- Added search bar to top menu
- Styling for page and post (top heading top margin)

- Linked Title in nav to home page 
- WP menus (bookmarked youtube tutorial)
- Added smaller post thumbnails

- learn about coffee culture

- latest posts doesn't list most recent post (which is already featured at the top)
- limit excerpt length

- post headline image (styling)
- featured post
- limit home page posts to 6
- latest articles on front-page.php. it displays "Home" because it uses a WP Page (the page has the instagram feed)--the current WP Query is for the page "Home" and not the site in general. Potential fix is to change the query and use something other than have_posts()
- embed instagram posts
- fixed scrolling bug
- restyle bottom logos (Follow Us)
- removed commented css and js

- remove scrolling when mobile menu is open
- move mobile menu with scroll y position
