TODO
- WP menu search bar functionality

FUTURE TODO
- archive.php + styling
- search.php (not official name) + styling
- recommendations.php (probably just search.php for recommendations tags without the search bar) + styling
- Post tags
- Add Related Posts

TODO LAUNCH
- Set up menus
- Set "Instagram" page
- Link Coffee Culture Posts

DONE
- Added search bar to top menu
- Styling for page and post (top heading top margin)

PAST
- Linked Title in nav to home page 
- WP menus (bookmarked youtube tutorial)
- Added smaller post thumbnails

- learn about coffee culture

- latest posts doesn't list most recent post (which is already featured at the top)
- limit excerpt length

- post headline image (styling)
- featured post
- limit home page posts to 6
- latest articles on front-page.php. it displays "Home" because it uses a WP Page (the page has the instagram feed)--the current WP Query is for the page "Home" and not the site in general. Potential fix is to change the query and use something other than have_posts()
- embed instagram posts
- fixed scrolling bug
- restyle bottom logos (Follow Us)
- removed commented css and js

- remove scrolling when mobile menu is open
- move mobile menu with scroll y position
- move open mobile menu with user presses tab
- click outside mobile menu to close it
