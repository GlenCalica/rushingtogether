# Rushing Together
This project is a custom WordPress template made from scratch for a personal blog.

Before developing the website, I designed wireframes and the design for the website using AdobeXD (the file is in this repo).

I pulled data (e.g., blogs and taxonomies) from the backend using WordPress developer functions and populated the site using PHP and HTML and styled the site using SASS.
There's minimal JavaScript used in this project: mainly used for the sliding menus.

*There's no live example of this project.
